# SciPy Examples

1. Install Python 3.8+ with tkinter support. On Windows that means you cannot
   use the Python distribution from the Microsoft Store, which tkinter is not
   included. Instead, [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) the
   [full installer](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#windows-full).
1. *Optional* Create and activate a virtual environment with
   [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) with:

    python -m venv myenv
    myenv/Scripts/activate

1. Install prerequisites:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
