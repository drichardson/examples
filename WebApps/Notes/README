The Notes webapp consists of a Django backend that implements a JSON web API used by the Javascript in the client. The client is built on Prototype and Scriptaculous.

The pieces are tied together using Apache's mod_proxy. lighttpd serves the static content. However, mod_python is not used for the Django backend, instead, mod_proxy is used to connect up to port 8000 where Django is listening when the development server is running. This is not recommended but I did it just for experimentation purposes.
