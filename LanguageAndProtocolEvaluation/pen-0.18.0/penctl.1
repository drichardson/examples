.TH PENCTL 1 LOCAL

.SH NAME
penctl

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B penctl
host:port command

.SH EXAMPLE
penctl lbhost:8888 roundrobin

Turns off client tracking on the load balancer running on lbhost.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Penctl
connects to the optional control socket on a pen load balancer.
It reads commands from the command line, performs minimal syntax
checking and sends them to pen. Replies, if any, are printed on stdout.

The program can also be used through the cgi script penctl.cgi,
which allows pen to be controlled from any web browser.

.SH OPTIONS

Specifies a control port where the load balancer listens for commands.

.SH COMMANDS
