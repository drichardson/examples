			Whether you are an admin, tech support, developer, or are responsible for keeping your mom&rsquo;s PC virus free, VNCClient will help you do your job faster. You no longer need to walk over to someone&rsquo;s desk or tediously instruct them step-by-step over the phone. Simply start up VNCClient, enter your customers Internet address, and take control of their computer. Of course, there are several other steps prerequisite to this procedure, such as installing and starting the VNC server on the other machine and configuring any routers to let port 5900 through. And sadly, VNCClient will bring you no joy when a user is experiencing network difficulties.
