# SPROUTCORE CONFIGURATION FILE
# Use this file to customize the URLs, source and output paths and other
# options used by the SproutCore build system to create the output for your
# SproutCore applications.

# If you want to use the libraries provided by other gems, require those gems
# here.  SproutCore will automatically locate and load any bundles found in
# your load path.  The sproutcore gem is automatically loaded for you.
#
# require 'sproutcore'

# This configuration section will be applied to all bundles used by your
# application, even bundles that come from other gems.
config :all do |c|

  # Name any other frameworks your bundles depend upon.  The stylesheets and
  # JavaScript for required bundles will be loaded before your bundle on your
  # page.
  c[:required] = [:sproutcore]

  
  # Set this to false to locate your clients at absolute paths.
  # (Uncomment and define c[:resources_at] if you set this to false.)
  # c[:resources_relative] = true

  # This string will be prepended before any URLs that reference JavaScript,
  # CSS or images in your files.
  c[:resources_at] = 'static'

  # This string will be prepended before any index.html urls that actually
  # load your clients.  Setting this to an empty string will mount all
  # of your clients at the root URL level.
  c[:index_at] = ''

  # If you also need to load external stylesheets not managed by the bundle
  # system, name the URLs you want to reference here.
  # c[:stylesheet_libs] = ['/stylesheets/public.css']

  # If you also need to load external javascripts not managed by the bundle
  # system, name the URLs you want to reference here.  These will be loaded
  # automatically.
  # c[:javascript_libs] = ['/javascript/scriptaculous.js']

  # This is the preferred language.  When the user visits the root URL of
  # your client, this is the language they will get.  When looking for a
  # resources (such as an image or stylesheet), SproutCore will also try
  # your preferred language .lproj if it cannot find the resource in the
  # current language.
  # c[:preferred_language] = :fr

  # If you want to use a default root layout template other than the default
  # provided by SproutCore, you can specifiy the path name to the index.rhtml
  # here.  If you provide a relative path, SproutCore will assume the file
  # is relative to the root of this project.
  #
  # c[:layout] = 'lib/index.rhtml'

  # This is the fully qualified path to the directory you want all of your
  # static files stored in.  You can place any files not managed by the build
  # system here.  SproutCore will also save its cached resources here.
  # c[:public_root] = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'public')

  # line as well using the -e option, but you can override the default
  # using this config as well.

  # JavaScript is only minified in production.  This only has effect if you
  # are also building composite javascript in the same mode.
  #c[:minify_javascript] = :production
  
  # Name the build modes that you want your JavaScript to appear as a 
  # composite file instead of the individual parts.  This can be an array.

  # instead of individual parts.  This can be an array.
